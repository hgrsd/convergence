#### A REStful API that helps you find the ideal place to meet.

Convergence is a RESTful API built using Flask and using the Google Maps API that helps groups of friends, colleagues, or acquiantances, find the ideal place to meet.

Users of Convergence can create groups and add others to these groups. Each user can specify whether or not they are "available" for the next get-together.  Convergence will suggest several suitable places, based on distance, travel times, and ratings, to meet with all those within your group who are keen to come.
